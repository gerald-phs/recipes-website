    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>
        <q>There is no cookery like Italian cookery.</q> This the Cooker said to the crowd
    at that time. They were Parrot's disciples. I was behind his cottage, carefully listening
    to his puerile sermon, while I took notes directly on papyrus: all his recipes, I would expose them all to the world, so they would see Parrot for the conman he truly is. Ergo, ladies and gentlemen I give thee “Garlic & Oil Italian Pasta”.
    </p>

    <br>

    <p>
        It was invented back in 3921, when Ainsley Carrot, Parrot's father, founded the
    <code>University of Spice & Sorcery</code>, hoping to cook great food for the world
    to enjoy. This one's the very famous Italian alchemy named “Aglio i Olio”, which means
    “Garlic and Oil”, a mixture invented by Carrot and passed down to the First Twelve.
    It involves cooking pasta, frying garlic in great quality lipid, and adding sage.
    Remarkable. Let's get to it, <i>mes amis.</i>
