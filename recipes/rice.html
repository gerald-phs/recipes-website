    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>
    <q>The pan is <strong>alive</strong>. Listen very carefully to its wailing, and
    you shall never have burnt food again.</q> This the Cooker said to the crowd
    at that time. They were Parrot's disciples. I was behind his cottage, carefully listening
    to his puerile sermon, while I took notes directly on papyrus: all his recipes, I would expose
    them all to the world, so they would see Parrot for the conman he truly is. Thereby, ladies and
    gentlemen I give thee ‚ÄúJust Rice‚Äù.

    <br>

    <p>Rice is rice. This time, we know the techniques involved.
        Let's get to it, <i>mes amis.</i>
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Process:</h2>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>Pan. Olivol in, garlic chopped. Garlic in.</li>
        <li>Fry fry fry. Smells outstanding. Garlic out.</li>
        <li>Rice in. Fry fry. Diminish heat.</li>
        <li>Water in. Cover rice and a finger's worth more.</li>
        <li>Rice absorbs water, acquires <em>jouissance</em>. Too much of that, 
            and the rice turns
        into porridge. Not enough, and it's like chewing on small rocks.</li>
        <li>The gods are waiting. Courage required ahead;</li>
        <li>Tap water in finger. Wet finger abundantly. Here are the Words for this one:
            <ol type="A"> 
                <li><code>FIIK</code></li>
                <li><code>SEH</code></li>
                <li><code>BROM</code></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Heat diminish to 0. In one swift motion, briefly touch
            the edge of the pan with the wet finger. Duration: 9 picoseconds. DO NOT
            TOUCH IT WITH DRY FINGER. DO NOT ALTER THE RUNES: 9 picoseconds EXACTLY.
        </li>
        <li>There are two possible outcomes: (a) the water touches the edge of the pan
            and vaporizes instantly. This can only happen if the temperature is ‚â• 100¬∞C, which is water's boiling point. The metal cannot achieve
            such temperatures when moisture is present in the rice. Water has high specific heat capacity, which means it needs lots of energy to heat up, 
            and will take a while to cool down as well. Water = thermal insulator. So, if water makes <em>tsssss...</em> noise of immediate vaporization,
            good news: rice sufficiently dry, rice ready! or (b) the water touches the edge of the pan
            but <b>does not vaporize at all</b>. There is still water present in rice.
            Rice not ready. Wait a little longer!
