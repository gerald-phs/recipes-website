    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>
    <q>The pan is <strong>alive</strong>. Listen very carefully to its wailing, and
    you shall never have burnt food again.</q> This the Cooker said to the crowd
    at that time. They were Parrot's disciples. I was behind his cottage, carefully listening
    to his puerile sermon, while I took notes directly on papyrus: all his recipes, I would expose
    them all to the world, so they would see Parrot for the conman he truly is. Thereby, ladies and
    gentlemen I give thee ‚ÄúJust Rice‚Äù.

    <p>Rice is rice. This time, we know the techniques involved.
        Let's get to it, <i>mes amis.</i>
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><code>1</code> rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Process:</h2>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>Pan. Olivol in, garlic chopped. Garlic in.</li>
        <li>Fry fry fry. Smells outstanding. Garlic out.</li>
        <li>Rice in. Fry fry. Diminish heat.</li>
        <li>Water in. Cover rice and a finger's worth more.</li>
        <li>Rice absorbs water, acquires <em>jouissance</em>. Too much of that, 
            and the rice turns
        into porridge. To little, and it's like chewing on small rocks.</li>
        <li>The gods are waiting. Courage required ahead;</li>
        <li>Tap water in finger. Wet finger abundantly.
            <ol type="A">Here are the Words for this one: 
                <li style="color:aliceblue;

                           border-radius:2px; 
                           border-style:groove; 
                           font-family:'Georgia, serif'">FIIK</li>

                           border-width:2px; 
                           border-radius:2px; 
                           border-style:groove;

            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Heat diminish to 0. In one swift motion, briefly touch
            the edge of the pan with the wet finger. Duration: 9 picoseconds. DO NOT
            TOUCH IT WITH DRY FINGER. DO NOT ALTER THE RUNES: 9 picoseconds EXACTLY.
        </li>
        <li>There are two possible outcomes: (a) the water touches the edge of the pan
            and vaporizes instantly. Rice ready! or (b) the water touches the edge of the pan
            but <b>does not vaporize at all</b>. There is still water present in rice.
            Rice not ready. Wait a little longer!
