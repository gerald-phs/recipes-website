    <h1>Description</h1>

    <p>
        <q>A cow is born ‚Äî a steak, made.</q> This the Cooker said to the crowd
    at that time. They were Parrot's disciples. I was behind his cottage, carefully listening
    to his puerile sermon, while I took notes directly on papyrus: all his recipes, I would expose
    them all to the world, so they would see Parrot for the conman he truly is. Thereby, ladies and
    gentlemen I give thee ‚ÄúParrot's Secret Steak‚Äù.
    </p>

    <p>
        It was invented back in 3921, when Ainsley Carrot, Parrot's father, founded the
    <code>University of Spice & Sorcery</code>, hoping to cook great food for the world
    to enjoy. With the fall of meat prices due to lab-produced genetic-altered cow meat
    being highly available, steak was <b>on the bloody menu</b>, I tell you that much.
    This one's the great steak, which I stole from the Cooker, all steps included, searing,
    butter and all. There is no conceivable way to do steak like Carrot did it. This knowledge
    was passed down to the First Twelve, and is now lost in the sands of time. We have only
    the objective instructions: It involves searing a very thick slab of delicious meat, so as
    to retain moisture & taste. Delectable. Let's get to it, <i>mes amis.</i>
